🤖 Hey, Welcome!
So we built this awesome screen recording and video sharing platform using Next.js and Bunny.net. It's got everything you need - user login (thanks to Better Auth), screen recording built right in, easy video uploads, and you can share your videos with anyone through links. Want to keep something private? No problem - just toggle it to private. Oh, and we've added AI transcripts for your videos plus all the metadata you might need like video IDs and URLs. There's even a search bar so you're not endlessly scrolling to find that one video.
Running into issues or just getting started? Come hang out in our Discord! We've got 50k+ awesome people who are always ready to help each other out.

⚙️ What We're Working With 

Arcjet - Think of it as your app's bodyguard. It handles bot protection, rate limiting, email checks, and keeps the bad guys out. Best part? You don't need to write tons of code. Works with pretty much everything - Node.js, Next.js, Deno, Bun, you name it.

Bunny.net - This is our video powerhouse. Global CDN, edge storage, adaptive streaming - basically everything to make your videos look and load great. It handles the boring stuff like encoding automatically and keeps things secure with token-based protection. Plus, real-time analytics if you're into that.

Better Auth - Authentication made simple. It's TypeScript-first (we love type safety!), and handles login, two-factor auth, social sign-ins, and even multi-tenancy. No headaches.

Drizzle ORM - A lightweight, type-safe way to talk to your SQL database. It's modern, clean, and supports migrations, queries, and schema management without the bloat.

Next.js - Our main framework. Fast, scalable, and packed with features like server-side rendering and API routes. Perfect for building full-stack apps.

Tailwind CSS - Styling made easy. Just add utility classes right in your HTML and boom - custom UI without writing tons of CSS.

TypeScript - JavaScript's smarter sibling. Catches errors before they become problems and makes your code way more maintainable.

Xata - Serverless PostgreSQL that just works. Auto-scaling, zero-downtime migrations, real-time branching, and built-in search. Plus it's got this spreadsheet-like UI that's actually nice to use.
